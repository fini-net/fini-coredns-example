An example container with coredns serving files generated by
[dnscontrol](https://github.com/StackExchange/dnscontrol).

## Status

The zone files are build with dnscontrol and can be served
locally with coredns.

TODO: build container

## Usage

Check out [conf/coredns](conf/coredns) to see an example of serving
the domains in this repo.

Feel free to tweak the examples in `dns/*.js` and
run `just push` to regenerate the BIND files.

The [development processs](.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#development-process)
documents the subcommands available in `just` to work with this repo.
